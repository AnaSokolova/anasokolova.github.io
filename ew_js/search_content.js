On the abstract end, I work on coalgebra -- a unifying theory for the analysis of various transition systems and automata, based on category theory -- and in particular on behavioural semantics, traces, and the combination of probability and nondeterminism. On the more concrete side, I work on probabilistic systems (probabilistic automata) and concurrency theory. Among my contributions to probabilistic systems, is also my work on convex algebras. My interests are broad: I have also contributed to engineering areas in computer science like memory management and real-time systems, and I have made a contribution to security on probabilisitc anonimity. The most exciting research that I worked on, besides coalgebra, is on concurrent data structures and their semantics.

You can often find Harald and me on the cross-country skiing trails around Salzburg as long as there is snow, and on the rocks near Salzburg and Vienna the rest of the year. We love Kalymnos - it is a maximal element in the poset of places that we love ;-) and top among beloved holiday places. Other maximal elements for me are of course Vienna and Salzburg, Skopje, Ohrid, Saarbrücken and few more spots in Saarland, Lovran, and :-) yes, Eindhoven and Nijmegen. All these are places with dearest people or many nice memories. My twin sister Maja is an artist and art teacher. My family is spread in five countries and two continents. Sometimes, especially during the pandemic I miss(ed) them all and my close friends far away. I condemn war and destruction. \"Live and let live\" is the slogan I like most.

The course is in the curriculum for the Bachelor DIS (Digitalisation, Innovation, Society) study, as well as for the cross-faculty teaching program CSSA (CS Skills for All). The course has become popular as a choice course, and is recommendable, also for starting Bachelor CS students and for students of the Teacher Training in CS program. In the course we teach basic topics of CS using simple suitable problems, often formulated as riddles and games. The students learn to solve problems systematically and get acquainted with basic topics in computer science. The students work in groups during class and solve the problems that we have prepared for them. In addition, the students solve problems given in 4 Homework Assignments, also in groups of 4 students. These assignments are graded. Finally, there is a small test towards the end of the semester, that contributes to 1\/3 of the grade. The course has been taught in German and in English, usually we have one group in German and one in English. Here are the topics and materials that we use for the course (note that the order and some of the topics change from year to year): Week 1: Introducton ( slides , slides-all-stages ) Week 2: Representing Information ( English , German ) Week 3: Sorting Algorithms I ( English , German ) Week 4: Sorting Algorithms II ( English , German ) Week 5: Rewriting ( English , German ) Week 6: Normal Algorithms ( English , German ) Week 7: Graph Algorithms I ( English , German ) Week 8: Graph Algorithms II ( English , German ) Week 9: Backtracking (English, German ) Week 10: Finite Automata ( English , German ) Week 11: Turing Machines ( English , German ) Week 12: Reductions and Computability ( English , German ) Week 13: Game of Life Jakob-Haringer-Str. 2 5020 Salzburg Room 2.17 +43 662 8044 6417 anas@cs.uni-salzburg.at Ana Sokolova Associate Professor Computational Systems Group Department of Computer Science University of Salzburg","tags":"","url":"psat.html","UUID":"F4031E0C00C54161A9F6A4E81E9EF88F"}]};
