Abstract:
---------

"Trace semantics" has been defined for various non-deterministic 
systems with different input/output types, or with different types  
of "non-determinism" such as classical non-determinism (with a set of 
possible choices) vs. probabilistic non-determinism. In this paper we 
claim that those various forms of "trace semantics" are instances of 
a single categorical construction, namely coinduction in a Kleisli 
category. This claim is based on our min technical result that an 
initial algebra in the category of sets and functions yields a final 
coalgebra in the Kleisli category, for monads with suitable order 
structure. The proof relies on coincidence of limits and colimits, 
like in the work of Smyth and Plotkin.
