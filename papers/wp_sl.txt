Term rewriting system for solving the word problem for sloops

The variety of Steiner loops (or sloops) consists of algebras of type
<2,0> satisfying the laws (S1), (S2) and (S3). The word problem for the variety
of sloops is solvable, as a consequence of a theorem of T. Evans.
Here we use a direct approach, i.e. we define a term rewriting system that
solves the word problem for sloops, in such a way obtaining a more
effective algorithm than the Evans' algorithm.
