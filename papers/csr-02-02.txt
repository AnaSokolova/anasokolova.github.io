Algebraic representation of bisimulation for the tagh-format
Technical Report CSR 02-02, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, 2002

Process behavior is often described in terms of structural
operational semantics. For a wide class of such rules, viz. those
adhering to the GSOS format or to the tagh-format, it is possible
to obtain automatically a finite axiomatization that characterizes
strong bisimulation. Here we go a bit further and show for this
format how to obtain canonical representatives of bisimulation
equivalence classes under a condition of well-foundedness. This we
do by constructing the initial algebra in the variety of
semi-lattices over the axiomatization of a system.
