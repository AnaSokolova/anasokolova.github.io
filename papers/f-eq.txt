On the functional equation $A(x, B(x,y)) = y$ in the variety of
groupoids

In this paper we focus on finding general solutions of the functional
equation $A(x,B(x,y))=y$ in the class of groupoids where $A,\ B$ are unknown
groupoid operations over the same set. We also consider
functional equations symmetric to the mentioned one, as well as systems of
such functional equations.
