 Abstract:
 ---------

 We propose a coalgebraic definition of weak bisimulation for a class of
 coalgebras obtained from bifunctors in $\mathsf{Set}$. Weak bisimilarity for a
 system is obtained as strong bisimilarity of a transformed system. The
 transformation consists of two steps: First, the behaviour on actions is
 expanded to behaviour on finite words. Second, the behaviour on finite
 words is taken modulo the hiding of invisible actions, yielding behaviour
 on equivalence classes of words closed under silent steps. The coalgebraic
 definition is justified by two correspondence results, one for the classical
 notion of weak bisimulation of Milner and another for the notion of weak
 bisimulation for generative probabilistic transition systems as advocated
 by Baier and Hermanns.
