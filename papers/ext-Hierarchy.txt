A hierarchy of probabilistic system types

Abstract:
----------

We arrange various classes of probabilistic systems studied in the
literature in an expressiveness hierarchy. Our expressiveness
criterion is the existence of a system translation, from the less
expressive type into the more expressive type, that preserves and
reflects probabilistic bisimilarity. We model the different system
types as coalgebras of suitable behavior functors and argue that
the corresponding coalgebraic bisimilarity coincides with
probabilistic bisimilarity for the classes for which the latter
notion has been proposed in the literature. The theory of
coalgebras provides a unified framework for the presentation of
the different classes and the system translations we needed to
establish the hierarchy. All these translations arise in a
standard way from natural transformations between the two behavior
functors involved. Such a translation generally preserves
coalgebraic bisimilarity. We exploit a new result that, under mild
assumptions on the behavior functors, a system translation induced
by a natural transformation with injective components also
reflects bisimilarity.
