Hi Ichiro,

Here are the comments I have, decided that it is faster if I type them in as a list. Sending the draft with written comments would take a week and there is a danger that my scrible-ing is not readable :-).

So, at least I can sit and type them in. Sorry that it took longer.

As I said I like it a lot. In general, all my comments are about little things in the writing and the presentation. Most of them are about the introduction - since also I think we have to try and make it really good. So, most of my comments are about some English writing or so, perhaps my suggestions are also not great, but maybe they will inspire you for a better change.

Otherwise, I really enjoyed reading again this nice stuff. Hmm, only at the very end I found Section 5 a bit "weak", hard to explain. Just it left me with a bit of unsatisfied feeling after reading it. But I understand your wish to include it in the paper, and I also think it is a step forward ... hmm, so I guess it is good to just keep it and see what the referees say.

For the rest, not much surprise, but nicely assembled all again :-). Hm, one more thing - I do not like the style in general, but I guess we can not change that. The font is very big, the centered section-titles are :-( ugly ... :-) well.

Ok, so here are my comments:
---------------------------------------------------------------
* page 1, my affiliation  ---> Department of Computer Sciences ("s" missing)

* (hmm, the affiliations are just listed, no footnote signs at the names ?? the style is in general somewhat strange, isn't it)

* Abstract, line 1, "notably with" ---> "with notably"

* Abstract, line 4, "This claim is based on our technical result" ---> Our results are based on the technical observation" (since 'the claim' is not really obvious ...)

* Abstract, line 6, "Formerly" ---> "Until now"

* Abstract, line 6, "has been employed mostly" ---> "has mostly been employed"

* Abstract, line 7, "a finer" ---> "the finer"

* Abstract, line 7, "of bisimilarity" ---> "bisimilarity" (I am not so sure about this one :-))

* Abstract, line 7, "Therefore this" ---> "This"

------------------------------------------------------------

* page 1, Introduction, line 4, ", most notably for" hmmm, I would rather change this to "among which are also"...

* page 1, line -1, "uncovering" ---> "revealing" or "disclosing" ?

* page 2, title of 1.1., just remove "is" or write "exists" instead of is.

* page 2, (1.1) I am not very fond of the fat-bold-triangle for grammar production rules, I prefer the more standard arrow, but it is up to you.

* page 2, line -1 rel. to (1.2) "For its" ---> "To its"

* page 2, line 1 rel.to (1.2) "behavior" ---> "behaviors", this thing is common further on. In general that sentence including (1.2) is not perfect, but can also stay so with the little change.

* page 2, (1.3) looks :-( ... in general especially in the intro there are this mixtures of text and formulas with strange formating. Here I
definitely prefer the two \iff formulas in displaymath, and below the text (one for both) "where <> is the empty word and \sigma...." Here also rather "in actions" instead of "on actions"

* page 2, second bullet, line 1, "more refined" ---> "different"

* page 2, second bullet, line 2, "for the state" ---> "to the state"

* page 2, second bullet, line 4, "behavior" ---> "behaviors".

* page 2, second bullet, line 8, "probability for" ---> "probability of".

* page 2, third bullet, line 5, "It is the" ---> "Hence, trace semantics in this case is also a"

* page 2, third bullet, line 5, "behavior" ---> "behaviors"

* page 2, third bullet, line 5,"similarly to" --->"as in"

* page 3, title of 1.2. :-) is a too big title for such a little section. I would call it just "Coinduction" or "Coinduction for coalgebras". Also I would add a list of standard coalgebra references at the end of the first sentence (before the dot). 

* page 3, line 2, "In the theory" ---> "In this theory"

* page 3, line 11, "have not been many works on capturing" ---> "are not many results that capture"

* page 3, line 11, "(those coarser" ---> "(coarser"

* page 3, line 12 i.e. 13 --- seems as if something is missing there, a line saying that this is what we do in this paper ... maybe ?

* page 3, line 1/2 of 1.3. Why do we fix Sets here already ? This came as a surprise to me -- and so did almost all of the assumptions somehow. 

* page 3, first bullet, line 1. I would add a sentence after "in a Kleisli category." saying "Let \Kl{T}$  denote the Kleisli category for T."

* page 3, first bullet, line 1, "Namely, commutativity" --->"Commutativity"

* page 3, first bullet, line 3, i.e. (1.5) I would just write here on the right "in Kl(T)" i.e. remove the second line of text and maybe format a bit.

* page 3, first bullet, line
