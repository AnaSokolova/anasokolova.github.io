Ana Sokolova and Erik de Vink:
On relational properties of lumpability

Abstract:
----------

The technique of lumping of Markov chains is one of the main tools
for recovering from state explosion in the quantitative analysis of
large probabilistic systems. Useful results regarding relational
properties of general, ordinary and exact lumpability, in particular
transitivity and strict confluence, are rather scattered or implicit in the
literature. These are collected and reformulated here from a
process-theoretic point of view. Additionally, counterexamples are
provided that complete the picture.
