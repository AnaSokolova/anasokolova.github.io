Compositionality for Markov Reward Chains with Fast Transitions  (abstract)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A parallel composition is defined for Markov reward chains with fast transitions 
and for discontinuous Markov reward chains. In this setting, compositionality with 
respect to the relevant aggregation preorders is established. For Markov reward 
chains with fast transitions the preorders are $\tau$-lumping and $\tau-reduction.
Discontinuous Markov reward chains are `limits' of Markov reward chains with fast 
transitions and have related notions of lumping and reduction. In total, four
compositionality results are shown. In addition, the two parallel operators are 
related by a continuity property.
