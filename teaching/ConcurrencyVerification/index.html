<b>Course description: </b> The aim of this course is to introduce advanced mathematical models for the formal description and
 analysis of programs, with emphasis on parallel, reactive systems. The course consists of 3 hours lectures per
 week and lasts for about 15 weeks. 
It deals with semantic models for parallel systems, and logics for the description of their properties. 
As part of the course material, we will also introduce automatic verification tools, and hint at some of 
the implementation techniques underlying them. The teaching consists of lectures interspersed with exercises.            

<br><br>
Via this course a practicaly oriented student learns the need of abstraction, formal specification and verification; 
the student interested in theory gets a solid introduction to formal methods for specification and verification. 
In particular, we will:
model simple systems using transition systems and (CCS) process expressions, 
deal with various notions of behaviour equivalences, learn the need of abstraction, 
formulate (and verify) properties of systems in Hennessy-Milner logic.

      <li>  Scriptum: <b>Introduction to Process Theory</b>, by <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~keesm/">Kees 
Middelburg</a> and <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~michelr/">Michel Reniers</a>, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven 2004, available <a href = "ProcessTheory.ps">here</a>.

<b>What is this theory good for? </b> A typical question asked by (practically oriented) students. The authors of the 
book Reactive Systems have compiled a nice 
<a href="http://www.ru.is/kennarar/luca/MV/">webpage</a> answering this question. Click on the corresponding link on the left to get to the needed subpage.             

<br><hr>

<b>Prerequisites: </b> None, the course material is self-contained, as is the textbook and the scriptum. 
Knowledge of basics of theoretical computer science like logic for computer science or automata theory is an asset. 

<br><hr>

<b>Exam: </b>  This is a VP course. There will be three exam possibilities in July/August. 
The exam is written consisting of several excersises from the material covered during the course (we will do an open-book exam). Additionally, 
the homeworks and the
mini project will also contribute to the final grade.
(mini project = 25%, homeworks = 10%, exam - the rest)

<br>

<b>Exam dates: </b> First exam possibility: Thursday 7.7.11, 10am, T06. Second exam possibility:
 Thursday 14.7.11, 10am, T06. If needed there will be a third exam possibility in the middle of August.

<br>

<b>Mini project: </b> t.b.a.
