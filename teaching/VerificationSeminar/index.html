<b>Seminar description: </b> Verification of finite state concurrent systems such as sequential circuit designs and communication protocols has been a vivid research topic in computer science for the past 30 years. The main objective is obtaining a formal proof of correctness of a system. Via verification techniques, practically oriented computer scientists learn the need of abstraction and formal reasoning. Students interested in theory will get an introduction to formal methods research for specification and verification. In this seminar, students will be assigned research papers or broader verification topics, which they need to study, understand, and present in class.
