<b>Course description: </b> Model checking is a technique for automatic 
verification of finite state concurrent systems such as sequential circuit 
designs and communication protocols. This method has advanced verification 
from a purely theoretical to an also practically applicable discipline. Its inventors <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~emc/">Edmund M. Clarke</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~emerson/">E. Allen Emerson</a>, and
<a href="http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~sifakis/">Joseph Sifakis</a> have 
been awarded the significant <a href="http://awards.acm.org/homepage.cfm?awd=140">Turing award</a> in 2007.

           

<br><br>
In this course we will learn the principles of model checking, namely 
modeling with transition systems, the temporal logics LTL and CTL, their comparison, 
as well as algorithms for verifying these logics. In addition, on 
the practical side, we will get acquainted with the basics of the SPIN model checker, 
one of the most commonly used model checking tools for automatic verification.

<hr>
<b>Prerequisites: </b> None, the course material is self-contained, as is the textbook. 
Knowledge of basics of theoretical computer science like logic for computer science or automata theory is an asset. 

<br><hr>

<b>Exam: </b>  This is a VP course. There will be three exam possibilities in June/July. 
The exam is written consisting of several excersises from the material covered during the course. Additionally, 
the homeworks and the
mini project will also contribute to the final grade.
(mini project = 25 points, homeworks = 11 points, exam = 100 points)
<br><br>

<b>Exam dates: </b> First possibility: Thursday 2.7.2009, 10am, T06. Second possibility: Monday 13.7.2009, 2pm, T06. 
Third possibility: Tuesday 25.8.2009, 2pm, T06.

<br><br>

<b>Mini projects:</b>
<br>
 (1) OBDDs, Bryant's work and extensions, implementation details (theoretical mini project) - Tobias Berka
<br>
 (2) Model checking garbage collection with SPIN - Andreas Haas
<br>
 (3) Model checking a security protocol with SPIN - Stefan Jenisch and Stefan Lukesch
<br>
 (4) Model checking non-blocking data structures with SPIN - Andreas Schoenegger
<br> 
(5) Logic(s) for probabilistic model checking (theoretical mini project) - Silviu Craciunas
<br><br>
The deadline for completing the mini projects is 15.7.2009. Each student should submit a concise description of the project and 
the results (up to 5 pages of text).

(*) There were 11 homework tasks. Each delivered homework task counts as one HW point.<br>
(**) Total = Exam points + HW points + Project points. The final mark is determined as follows:
1 if Total >= 105, 2 if 85 <= Total <= 104, 3 if 65 <= Total <= 84, 4 if 50 <= Total <= 64, 5 otherwise.
